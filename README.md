## Deployment

1. Clone this repository.
2. Update the `variables.tf` file with your specific configuration values.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
5. Review the Terraform plan: `terraform plan`
6. Apply the Terraform configuration: `terraform apply`

## Customization

The `variables.tf` file contains variables that you can customize for your environment. You can also modify the Terraform code directly to suit your needs.

## Environment-Specific Configurations

You can create separate directories for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) and maintain environment-specific configurations.
